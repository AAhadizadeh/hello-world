Salutations! 

This is my very first coding venture, and I rather like the font. It reminds me of Mr. Robot and also Player Piano.
I enjoy reading and twirling and baking, not necessarily in that order. I'm rather good at all of these things.
I haven't properly introduced myself, because I might change my name and inconsistencies make me nervous. You may call me Cat, since that is my patronus.
